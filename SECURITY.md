## 🧠 Security Review Process

All commits to `main` and `release` branches undergo:
- ✅ Automated static analysis using **Slither** & **MythX**
- ✅ Smart contract audit simulations via **SolidityScan** and **Securify**
- ✅ Manual review for critical logic functions (mint, transfer, ownership)

## 🛡️ Disclosure Policy

- Security issues will be disclosed **after a patch is released**.
- Responsible disclosure credits will be given to the reporter (if permitted).

## ⚙️ Recommended Developer Practices

To maintain security standards:
- Use **Solidity ≥ 0.8.25**  
- Use **OpenZeppelin Contracts v5+**  
- Always initialize constructors with ownership explicitly  
- Avoid `tx.origin` for authentication  
- Use **ReentrancyGuard** for payable or external function handling
